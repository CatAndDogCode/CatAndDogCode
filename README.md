- 👋 Hey, I'm Penelope (formally known as "Watermeloon")
- 👀 I like to animate and program discord bots with the language discord.js. I also know javascript.
- 🌱 Right now I'm taking an advanced bot coding course and a javascript course.
- 💞️ I like to create bots for others, if you'd like a bot for your discord server, feel free to contact me!
